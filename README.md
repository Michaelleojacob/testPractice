# testPractice - by Michael Jacob

# first time writing tests.

# probably the most time spent was figuring out how to write the Caesar Cipher again lol.

# second most time was invested into researching how I can use es6 syntax with jest.

# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35756479/does-jest-support-es6-import-export

# the first answer seemed to work for me.

# This was my first real hands on experience working with TDD. Found it really fun, and I look forward to practicing TDD.
